# About me

Iâ€™m currently writing C++ algorithms for **Desbordante**, an open-source data profiler designed to help researchers discover patterns in their data.  

love creating gamesâ€”right now Iâ€™m building a Godot project about relearning speech after a body transfer accident. I also have experience with Unity and C#.
